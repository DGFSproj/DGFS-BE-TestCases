This test case involves a one-dimensional normal shock problem. Shock waves are an important concept in the field of aerospace engineering and play an important role in the development of supersonic engines, turbomachinery, supersonic vehicle surfaces, rockets, missiles, and reentry vehivles. This DGFS of the Boltzmann equation provides clear allignment with the DSMC solution. 

The working gas in helium.
